## Welcome to the OpenSDN project
OpenSDN is an open-source, reliable and flexible platform for management of virtual networks. As a successor of the famous Tungsten Fabric (TF, OpenContrail, Contrail) technology, OpenSDN inherits all of TF powerful features:
- long history (more than 10 years) of succesful industrial usage with supermassive computing hardware;
- all-in-one approach (data plane, control plane, management plane and main VNF);
- the support for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols;
- MPLS and VxLAN overlay technologies;
- multi-tenancy;
- [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org) cloud computing platform;
- [CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org) computing platform;
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) technology.
